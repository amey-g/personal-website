        Did you ever get that feeling that you're just wasting your time and not doing anything at all. In this 4 month lockdown I had all the time one could ever want but still, I had no clue what to do. I had planned on learning something new like Web Development and Writing as hobbies but me being the expert procastinator that I am did nothing much. 4 months of my life passed by in a glimpse of a second. And I think the coming months would have been no different if I didn't do anything about it.

        That's when I stumbled upon the blogs of two of my seniors at Pilani Shubhankar Srivastava and Gyanendra Mishra. I went through their blogs and got deeply inspired to start blogging myself. Just like them I plan to keep a goal tracking as well as life update keeping blog. I also fell in love with the idea of documenting the most eventful years of your life and making it public to motivate yourself to not fall behind your goals.

        I'll be starting my sophomore year in college in less than a month. I would like to keep this blog as a way of tracking my short termed goals as well as life events (the ones which can be made public). As said by Shubhankar Bhaiya in his blog making your goals public drives you to complete them. The fact that there might be someone reading this, and him getting to know that you did not eat healthy today or did not workout today is embarrassing and the will to escape the embarrassment is what drives you further. So look forward to more such blogposts in the future, that is if there ever is someone reading this.
