          Happy Halloween!

          I'm posting after a month. A lot has happened in the past 30 days. Firstly, coming back to the goals I set for October. I finished all 4 (infact 6) of the Hactoberfest Pull Requests on the first day itself, I found a handy little repository in NodeJS and solved 3-4 issues on it, thus I completed my first goal. Now for fixing up my grades, I'm not quite there yet, I am still below average in most of my CDCs however, I am okay in my Humanities Courses. There is still some room for improvement as a lot of evaluatives are yet to be conducted and I don't lag behind too much tbh. On the fitness front, I've been pretty busy throughout the month so I could not (did not) take out time to excercise. However, I recently began going on night walks to take in some fresh (not so fresh in Delhi) air and get out of my bed where I am around 20 hours a day. Also, the Dopamine Detox was a success, I've officially not touched social media in the past 30 days and I can clearly see a peak in my productivity as well as mental peace.

          I also joined a startup as a backend developer. I was contacted by a senior who got to know that I've recently tried my hands on backend development. It's nice working on it, I got to practice my skills as well as learn some new stuff which I did not know before. But, now I want to explore other aspects of computer science as well and am thinking of trying something new and leave web development for a while. Cryptography and Blockchain is somethong which I started to fancy a few days back, So, I'll probably try to gain some new knowledge in these domains. Also, Machine Learning is something which I recently thought of trying out so I may even get my hands dirty on this.

          By the way, I dual booted Ubuntu 20.04 on my laptop a few days back alongside Windows 10 and I'm loving every bit of it (mainly the terminal and the customizations available). I also tried on a new template for my website and would be moving it to a heroku deployment of the same. In the last week I've been watching some stuff on youtube about Zuckerberg, Pichai and Gates and it made me wonder how some of the biggest companies in the world started of merely as a bunch of kids trying to make something cool and have some fun (Relevant mostly to Mark). I have been wanting to buld something cool myself and I'll try and come up with something fun to do in the near future.

          Okay, so let us set aside some goals for the next month to wrap things up. I would try to keep Acads my number one priority for November as I have Test-3 and multiple quizzes followed by my Comprehensive Exams in the first week of december so the list would probably be short.
          <ul>
            <li>Push up my grades (Highest Priority!!!!)</li>
            <li>Try out some new stuff and gain a reasonable amount of beginner level knowledge in that domain</li>
            <li>Focus on my health as well, try to eat healthier and be more active</li>
          </ul>

    <p class="para"> Hasta la vista </p>
