        So, before coming to the topic of this blog, I'll just post an update from my previous blog.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
          Okay, so the Instagram breakup did not go very well. I still find myself going back on to Instagram and Facebook from the browser despite deleting the apps. So, this goal failed big time but I still did reduce a lot of unnecassary screen-time. Also, the django backend for the blog is on a hold as I got into ither things at the end of august so that goal was a failure as well, which makes it a perfect score of 2/2 failed goals. Eeesh, I'll try to keep up to my goals from now, it really hurts when i fail to deliver upon those.

          Now coming back to the topic. I have officially completed my freshman year at BITS. I lost more than half of a semester on campus and also have been home for the past 6 months now and would be here for the next 4 atleast. I screwed up big time in my midsems and ended up with a 7.5ish SGPA but my first sem 9.1 landed me into a decent CGPA of 8.4 for the first year. BITS announced this semester to be conducted completely in the online mode like other colleges across India. This is sad, as you only get to spend some 16 months on campus and I lost 6 out of those. I miss the peace and freedom I had on campus, but most of all I miss my wingies and the fun I will be missing out on this semester. Online classes begun with full swing from the 17th of August and the one thing I am sure about is that this semester is gonna be really hard for me to study. Electronics is considered to be the most difficult and academically loaded major on campus and I can totally relate to why. Some of the profs who used to teach well on campus totally suck teaching online on slides. Some courses are extremely hard to understand while some are extremely hard to score in tests. Also, "Online" Labs are a thing now so wish me luck for that. I have tests in a week and I just hope I manage a good enough SG this semester as I'm planning to learn some other stuff as well other than acads.

          BITS requires students to take up Humanities Electives in their sophomore year to be able to graduate. Which in my honest opinion is a great thing as The Humanities often get neglected in a Engineering Student's life but the are some of the most important things to learn for an overall development of a student. I took up to HuEls this semester namely CALC (Critical Analysis of Literature and Cinema) and Cinematic Adaptation. I remember starting to watch classic cult films back in 9th grade and I have been a cinephile ever since. Honestly, these two are the courses which I am currently enjoying the most to sit through. In Cinematic Adaptation we are required to choose any movie based upon some form of literature and present an analysis of that movie, I'm really into this kind of stuff and am thoroughly enjoying it. Let's see what this semester has for me.

          To finish off this blog let me put up a set of goals for the month of september. 
        <ol>
            <li>Finally, start learning Django and finish the NodeJS Certification.</li>
            <li>Learn how to build a chrome extension and try to build one</li>
            <li>Try to balance my acads with the above two ðŸ™ƒ</li>
        </ol>  
      </p>

      <p class="para">Adios!</p>
