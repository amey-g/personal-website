        It's been a while since that first post. A lot has NOT changed. Firstly, i would commit that I am planning to go forward with this idea of blogging even though I was having some doubts in the past few weeks. So, I plan to shift this blog to a proper website with a proper backend and frontend instead of me typing inside the html like I am right now, LOL. I plan to get done with this by the end of the month since I'll probably learn django for this. I hope to complete this goal.

        Now, coming back to the topic for this blog. I have been on facebook for more than a decade and instagram for i dont know maybe 7 years now. I was never addicted to them. However, in the last 4 years, I observed that a significant chunk of my day went aimlessly scrolling through instagram. I'm sure many of you would have had found yourself running out of new posts on instagram and closing it down only to reopen it subconsciously. That's when it hit to me to quit instagram. To be honest, I used to love instagram back in the day around 2015. Instagram was like facebook but with just the good stuff. It did not feel bloated or overly complex like it's major competitors back in the day. But ever since Facebook came into the picture and aquired Instagram it has become more and more like facebook, filled with ads and bloated with unneccessary stuff.

        So, the day before yesterday I uninstalled instagram and facebook (which I only used for my college groups) from my phone and already I can feel that I have extracted a lot of time from my day. I think about random stuff and ideas when I'm bored instead of scrolling on screen. I feel an increase in my brain activity and also productivity. I have almost no reason to use my phone now except for making calls. I hope to continue this for atleast a month. However, it is hard to stop the urges. I did find myself opening the websites for FB and Instagram and scrolling there, this however did not take more than 5 minutes. So for anyone reading this, I suggest you to try this for yourself snd let me know what changed. That is however, if there is anyone ever reading this ðŸ˜‰.
