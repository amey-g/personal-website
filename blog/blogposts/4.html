        September is over. I managed to complete (or I think so) all of the goals I set up for the month of september, which I take as an indication of setting the bar too low. However, I'll be done with my Node JS certification tomorrow which took too long for it's length, but atleast I completed it. Also I tried out the chrome extension thingy and it turned out to be suprisingly really easy, I had no clue that a chrome extension is nothing but a mini html document. 
        Coming to acads, I'm hanging in there just right. I'm floating around the av in most of my courses and much below in some. So I guess managing acads is something I should focus upon as well. But, with a completely online semester and unproctured tests guys who try to remain honest are getting the worst hit by inflated averages so, I have to figure a way around that.

        Now, coming to the month of October I have some big plans lined up. Firstly, I am planning to participate in Hacktoberfest which is basically an Open Source promoting competition, I plan to contribute in backend javascript for OSS organisations. I have to make 4 Pull Requests for that so I'll set this up as the first goal.

        Secondly, I'll be trying to focus more on the fitness end and start exercising again, I have had bare minimum human activity from the past 6 months and I need to change up things for the better.

      <p class="para">
        Next, I would like to try and fix up my acads and get my grades straight. I have been neglecting acads for the past month and would try to come back on track in the next 2 weeks.

        Finally, I'm going to try a challenge with a couple of wingies this month. 4 of us would be taking the 'Dopamine Detox' Challenge wherin we try to isolate ourselfs from things which provide us with unhealthy, short-lived and easyily available doses of dopamine in our daily lives. This includes quitting social media, isolating yourself from junk on the internet and using this time productively and efficiently into developing skills, pursuing hobbies and interests or any other thing, doing so we aim to make our brain hungry for these long term healthy doses of dopamine and make us enjoy working and doing these tasks. It's basically a way to trick your brain into loving work. I hope this goes well. Let's see how October goes. Bye
